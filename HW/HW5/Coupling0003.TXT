------------------- Impedance and Termination Summary --------------------

Differential Z   = 99.9 ohms
   (suggested single line-to-line resistor for differential signals;
    works best for opposed, balanced transitions)
Odd-mode Z       = 49.9 ohms

Common-mode Z    = 26.8 ohms
Even-mode Z      = 53.6 ohms
   (suggested single line-to-ground resistor for common-mode signals;
    works best for all-1's or all-0's transitions)

Line-to-ground Z = 51.8 ohms
   (suggested single line-to-ground resistor for independent signals;
    works best for mixed 1's and 0's transitions)

Optimal termination (requires 3 resistors)
   line to line     = 1464.9 ohms
   line 1 to ground = 53.6 ohms
   line 2 to ground = 53.6 ohms
   (suggested for terminating all of the above modes simultaneously;
    but you may have to AC couple one or more resistors to maintain
    proper DC levels)

(Note: Off-diagonal values are negative by mathematical convention.
However, the capacitances are physically real; you can effectively
ignore the signs. The signs are required, though, if transporting
matrix data to another tool.)
